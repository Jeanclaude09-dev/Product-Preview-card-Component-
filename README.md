### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- HTML picture tag

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 476px)"
    srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    class="product"
  />
  <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" class="product" />
</picture>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  letter-spacing: 0.25rem;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on responsiveness and Grid

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQDgoQKfdzM&t=850s) - This is an amazing viedo which helped me finally understand responsive images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning it.
